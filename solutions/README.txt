Fill out problems_done.txt correctly.

Place your source code for each solved problem in the appropriate folder
(e.g. an easy problem from UVa goes into UVa_easy). Ensure each file has the
proper comment header. We should be able to submit your file exactly as is and
have it accepted. Do NOT include source code unless it is accepted by the
appropriate judge system.

Each folder should simply contain the different source code files for the
various problems you solved. Do not submit compiled executables, sample
input/output files, etc. No subdirectories. Up to a 2% deduction may be
applied for each milestone if your most recent astep submission is not
correctly organized this way.

Name the source code files the following way:

uva_<number>.[language extension]
kattis_<id>.[language extension]

E.g.

uva_100.cpp
uva_200.java

kattis_cardgame.cpp
kattis_bridges.py

As the empirical hardness classification may change over time, for challenging
problems please also provide screenshots (jpg file of size < 500KB) of the
problem statistics at the time you solved the problems.

E.g. if uva_xyz.cpp appears in uva_challenging/, then uva_challenging/ should
also contain screenshot uva_xyz.jpg indicating that problem xyz is indeed
classified challenging.

Bundle everything into a single tarfile using

  tar cfz solutions.tgz ...

and submit via:

astep -c c403 -p sol solutions.tgz

Submit regularly as you solve problems! Your most recent submission before
each milestone will be the one that is checked for that milestone.
